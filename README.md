# Carson's Team - Agent HQ Animation

**Live:** https://crsnpalmer-art.github.io/agent-hq/

## Project Overview
An interactive office environment showcasing Carson's AI agent team. Each agent has a desk, personality, and animated presence.

## Structure
- **`index.html`** - Clean landing page
- **Current build:** Lives in `~/clawd/agent-hq/index.html` (GitHub Pages deployment)
- **Archive:** Old iterations stored in `_archive/` folder

## Workflow
1. Edit locally in `~/clawd/cpbama-avatar/` or directly in `~/clawd/agent-hq/`
2. Copy final version to `~/clawd/agent-hq/index.html`
3. Commit & push to deploy live

## Creative Vision
**Theme:** Modern tech office with personality
- Clean, minimalist UI
- Subtle animations (breathing, typing, idle movements)
- Each agent has distinct visual identity
- Responsive design that works on mobile/desktop

**Direction:**
- Less is more - reduce clutter, focus on agents
- Add depth with lighting, shadows
- Make agents feel alive but not distracting
- Consider adding sound effects (subtle, optional)
- Future: Interactive chat with agents?

## Daily Maintenance
- Review live site for bugs
- Check GitHub issues
- Refine animations based on feedback
- Update agent roster as team grows
