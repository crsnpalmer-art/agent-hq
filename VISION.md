# Creative Vision - Agent HQ

## Core Concept
**"A window into Carson's AI team office"** — not a dashboard, not a control panel. An *actual office* where you can see the team working.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. **Personality > Features**
Each agent should feel *alive*:
- Unique idle animations
- Distinct color schemes
- Character-appropriate movements (Kae gestures, Sentinel watches, etc.)

### 2. **Subtlety Wins**
- Breathing animations: 3-5 second cycles
- Typing: occasional, not constant
- Ambient lighting that shifts slowly
- No jarring movements

### 3. **Depth & Space**
- Use shadows to create layers
- Perspective on desks
- Lighting from ceiling fixtures
- Floor tiles for depth perception

### 4. **Responsive Reality**
- Mobile: Stack desks vertically, reduce detail
- Desktop: Full office layout with spatial relationships
- Ultra-wide: Add windows, plants, environmental details

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅
- [x] Basic office layout
- [x] Agent desks with monitors
- [x] Breathing animations
- [x] Live deployment

### Phase 2 (Next)
- [ ] Add "status indicators" (busy, available, thinking)
- [ ] Click on agent to see what they're working on
- [ ] Add ambient sound toggle (keyboard clicks, coffee machine)
- [ ] Day/night mode based on time of day

### Phase 3 (Future)
- [ ] Interactive chat with agents
- [ ] Real-time activity feed (when agents complete tasks)
- [ ] Agent hiring/onboarding animation
- [ ] Conference room for team meetings

## Technical Goals
- Keep bundle size under 100KB
- No external dependencies
- 60fps animations
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## Inspiration
- Slack's office illustrations
- Notion's personality
- Apple's attention to detail
- Pixar's character animation principles

**Remember:** Every element should either add personality or improve clarity. If it does neither, cut it.
